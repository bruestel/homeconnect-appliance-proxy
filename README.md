# Home Connect - Home Appliance Proxy

A cross-platform JavaFX-based application that acts as a proxy for Home Connect smart home appliances.

## Overview

This tool enables deep inspection and debugging of the communication between the official Home Connect app and smart home appliances.
It works by impersonating a Home Connect appliance and relaying traffic between the real device and the Home Connect app.

## Features

- üîç **Discovery via mDNS**: Automatically searches for Home Connect devices on the local network using multicast DNS (mDNS).
- üé≠ **Device Emulation**: Can impersonate a Home Connect home appliance, mimicking its identity on the network.
- üîÑ **Message Interception**: Acts as a man-in-the-middle, intercepting messages between the Home Connect app and the actual appliance.
- üîì **Message Decryption**: Intercepted messages are decrypted and displayed to the user for analysis.
- üîÅ **Transparent Forwarding**: While messages are inspected, they are also forwarded to the actual device, ensuring seamless operation for the Home Connect app.

## Platform Compatibility

- ‚úÖ Windows
- ‚úÖ macOS
- ‚úÖ Linux

## Use Cases

- Reverse engineering of the Home Connect protocol
- Debugging custom smart home integrations
- Security research and analysis
- Learning how IoT appliances communicate on local networks

## Requirements

- Java 21 or higher
- Gradle build tool
- Operating System: Windows, Linux, or macOS

## How It Works

Follow these steps to run the Home Connect Appliance Proxy:

1. **Start the application**  
   Launch the app using either of the following methods:
    - `./gradlew run`
    - or
    - `java -jar ./build/libs/home-connect-appliance-proxy-linux-x.y.z.jar`

2. **Wait for your appliance to appear**  
   The application will search the local network for Home Connect appliances via mDNS.

3. **Configure the secrets**  
   If you don't already have the cryptographic profile of your appliance (required to decrypt messages), you can use the following project to obtain it:  
   üëâ [homeconnect-profile-downloader](https://github.com/bruestel/homeconnect-profile-downloader)

4. **Start the proxy**  
   Once the secrets are in place and the appliance has been detected, start the proxy.

5. **Restart the official Home Connect app**  
   Fully close the Home Connect app on your Android or iOS device ‚Äî make sure it is force-closed (swiped away). Then reopen it.

6. **Observe the connection**  
   The official app should now connect to the proxy instead of the real appliance.  
   If it doesn't work on the first try, repeat step 5 a couple of times.

Once connected, the proxy will display and forward decrypted communication between the Home Connect app and your actual appliance.

## Build and Run

1. Clone the repository
2. Build the project using Gradle: `./gradlew build`
3. Start the application: `java -jar ./build/libs/home-connect-appliance-proxy-linux-x.y.z-SNAPSHOT.jar`
